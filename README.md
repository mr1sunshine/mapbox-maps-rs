# mapbox-maps-rs

### About this project.

- This is an experimental hobby-style project which has only one practical goal at the moment - to implement a graphical engine to draw maps using Rust programming language.
- Please don't expect any regular updates on this activity since it is developed in my free time.
- Any contributions are very welcomed!

### Implementation details

From the implementation and design point of view, I'm thinking at the moment that the best approach would leveraging ideas for architecture from [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) and [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native).
